<h3>
    My project is about the budget of the films and whether they influence the popularity of the film.
I did the work both at school and at home. I enjoyed doing the fun of creating something of your own to shape it and give it "meaning".
I learned a lot from working first and foremost about the field I chose and also how to work with the flask and how to change and create things only with code writing.
